# Exploit demo for dirty pipez vulnerability in Linux Kernel

During Proactive Computer Security at DIKU, we give a small
presentation about different papers/vulnerabilities/concepts.

This repo contians exploits and different payloads
for the dirty pipez vulnerability, which allows
writing to readonline files, and therefore
privilege escalation.

## Setup
We use a vagrant file to set up a VM with the correct
Linux kernel version.

First we had to find a VM with the correct linux kernel version.

According to the following table, Groovy Gorilla has version 5.8
so it should be suited for exploit development and the demo.

## Payloads, demos

We want to present different payloads, stuff you can do with
the exploit, further it should become clear what constraints
the exploit has - whats possible and whats not.


### Root shell


### Modifying readonly files
- explore which interesting linux files we could change etc.
